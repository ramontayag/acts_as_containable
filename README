ActsAsContainable
=================

Created for use with acts_as_ordered_tree (or acts_as_tree) where you may need to put different models as elements in that tree. This is the coded solution answered here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2142285/acts-as-tree-with-multiple-models


Installation
============
ruby script/plugin install http://path/to/this/repo

If you want to have more explicit rules as to what can be a parent of what, then

1) copy vendor/plugins/acts_as_containable/lib/container.rb
2) Add rules like

Example
=======

class MyModel < AR::Base
	acts_as_containable
end

class MyModelsController < ApplicationController
	acts_as_containable

	#Have all actions except destroy and create, unless you want to override them
end
